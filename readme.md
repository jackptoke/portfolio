## Differences in protype and finished products
- The absence of left sidebar in the finished product was because as I have further developed the concept, I like the look without the red bar better than with it.
- The menu bar of the finished product doesn't have the red background anymore, because the red background doesn't integrate well with parallax scrolling effect.

##Target Audience
The target audience of this web project are prospect employers or recruiters
