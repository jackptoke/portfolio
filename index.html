    <h1>My background</h1>
    <p>I was born in Burma, some thirty years ago.  Due to intense fighting and the government troop undiscrimatingly bombarded my village, my whole family left that country. I was just 1 when that happened.  I spent most of my childhood moving from place to place in a foreign country, squating in the jungle and in makeshift huts.  In 1994, things became more destabelised and we were forced to move into a refugee camp, some 600km north-west of Bangkok.  I lived there with some other 30-40 thousands people until 2007, when Australia, under the leadership of Prime Minister John Howard, granted me a refugee visa.  Boy, I was glad to leave the place!</p>

    <h1>Australia</h1>
    <p>Australia has given me many great things.  It gave me opportunities for further education, it gave me stability, it gave me hope.  It allows me meet and make many wonderful friends.  It gives me life, a more abundant life.  Life without fear, life with a future to look forward to and the ability to build my own future.  My imagination is the only limitation. Most importantly...</p>

    <h1>Australia gave me its heart</h1>
    <p>It gave me its finest.  Her name is Amy.  We met at a youth conference not too far from here actually, at the Victoria College of Arts. It took a year before I managed to woo her trust and we went on our first date.  We went to Werribee Zoo, out of all the places.  Our second date was at High Point.  A year and a half later we were married in Geelong</p>

      <h1>Back to Thailand</h1>
      
      <p>A year after we got married, we had our first son.  Just when he was just 3 months old, we decided to go on an adventure that lasted us 6 six years.  I taught at the very high school I graduated from for two years, August 2013 - March 2015.</p>

      <h1>Into the war torn mountain of Burma</h1>

      <p>If being in the refugee camp is challenging enough, I decided to go into the conflict zone in the upper part of Karen state, in villages in remote region.  I worked as an advocate, fundraiser and training coordinator for 16 primary schools, 3 middle school and 1 high school.</p>

      <h1>Coming back home</h1>
      <p>After 6 years, we now have 3 children - Josiah, the eldest, Jeremiah, the middle one, and Adrielle, my little honey badger. We nick named her badgie, because she's fearless and tough.  Her look can be deceptive. The kids are growing.  My eldest is of a school age and my wife needs a better support system to give him the best that a parent can afford.  All my families are here, all her families are obviously here.  She'll do a better job with all their supports. Now, I need to provide for my own family.  What better career to pursue than a career in software development?</p>

      <h1>Coder Academy</h1>
      <p>But the skills I have acquired in university back in 2010, is probably out dated. I looked at job advertisement on www.seek.com.au and I don't understand half of the thing they require, such as REACT, Node.js, Express, MangoDB etc.  I need to re-skill myself.  What a better place to do that than Coder Academy.</p>
